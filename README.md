## Hi, I’m Atharv 👋

I work at the intersection of data, systems, and decision-making.

Most recently, I worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst at XYA, where I built product analytics workflows, designed dashboards, and translated complex data into insights for GTM and product teams.

Earlier in my career, I worked in developer-facing roles within the cloud-native ecosystem (Kubernetes, APIs, DevTools), which shaped my interest in how modern SaaS products are built, monitored, and scaled.

After a short break, I’m rebuilding in public — focusing on hands-on projects around:
- APIs & integrations
- Observability & monitoring concepts
- Cloud-native tooling
- Data pipelines & system behavior analysis

I’m particularly interested in Solutions Engineering roles where I can combine:
- Technical depth
- Analytical thinking
- Clear communication
- Customer empathy

### Currently working on
- Small integration demos (API + logging + data capture)
- Cloud-native experiments
- Practical system design breakdowns

If you're hiring for entry-level Solutions Engineer roles or want to collaborate on technical demos — I’d love to connect.
